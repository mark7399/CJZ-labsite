### Research Direction 1: Multi-omics Network Analysis and Precision Oncology

* **Challenge:** The regulatory relationships of multi-omics data (such as gene, protein, and metabolic networks) exhibit cross-scale and weak association characteristics, making it difficult for traditional methods to discover their abnormal molecular regulation patterns.
* **Our Method and Achievements:** We have proposed an innovative **higher-order graph matching method**, which has been successfully applied to analyze the metastasis patterns of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The study found that by distinguishing between hematogenous and lymphatic metastasis, more precise personalized treatment plans (such as local radiotherapy vs. immunotherapy) can be guided.
* **Clinical Impact:** The precision treatment decisions guided by this method have **increased the 2-year progression-free survival rate of patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma by 20.5%**. Related achievements have been published in journals such as IEEE TPAMI and JBHI.

### Research Direction 2: Multimodal Brain Network Analysis and Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases

* **Challenge:** Multimodal brain networks (such as structural and functional networks) are irregular graph structures embedded in high-dimensional manifold spaces. Traditional Euclidean analysis methods can greatly destroy their topological information, making it difficult to identify pathological propagation pathways.
* **Our Method and Achievements:** We have developed a **graph harmonic manifold learning** method that can effectively identify the key pathways of Tau protein pathological propagation in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
* **Clinical Impact:** The pathways identified by this method are highly correlated with core indicators of early AD screening (such as MMSE scores). Compared with baseline methods, in the early AD screening task, the **accuracy is improved by 25.2%, sensitivity by 42.1%, and specificity by 29.5%**. Related achievements have been published in journals and conferences such as IEEE TMI, JBHI, and IPMI.

### Research Direction 3: Multi-source Heterogeneous Data Fusion and Diagnosis of Chronic Brain Diseases

* **Challenge:** Fusing heterogeneous data from multiple sources (such as medical imaging, clinical text, and genomics) is a huge challenge because existing graph computing methods find it difficult to effectively transfer information between networks with different node types and connection attributes.
* **Our Method and Achievements:** We have designed a **graph discriminative fusion learning framework** that can effectively fuse multi-source heterogeneous features and significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy of various chronic brain diseases.
* **Clinical Impact:** Verified on three large public databases (ADNI, ADHD-200, MDD-meta-project), compared with clinical diagnostic baseline methods, our method **improves the average diagnostic accuracy by 17%**. Specifically, it improves by 17.9% for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), 10.3% for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and 22.9% for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Related achievements have been published in journals such as IEEE TNNLS and Medical Image Analysis.
